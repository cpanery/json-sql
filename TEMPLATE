# JSON-SQL

JSON-SQL is a specification which defines a standard for describing SQL
statements using language-agnostic representations (data structures). This
specification aims to be standards-compliant, i.e. supporting the full-range of
SQL-92 expressions, and to enable the development of better (more accurate and
robust) SQL statement generation, libraries, object-mappers, and other tooling.
The specification is a valid JSON-Schema document which can be validated using
any JSON-Schema validator with support for
_"https://json-schema.org/draft/2019-09/schema"_.

## Features

- vendor-agnostic
- language-agnostic
- sql as a data exchange format
- pre-flight sql statement syntax validation
- common sql coverage (99.999% standards-compliant)

**note:** sql parser and generator not included

## Demonstration

This example JSON-SQL data structure:

```
{
   "table-create" : {
      "name" : "inactive_users",
      "query" : {
         "select" : {
            "columns" : [
               {
                  "column" : "*"
               }
            ],
            "from" : {
               "table" : "users"
            },
            "where" : [
              {
                "eq": [
                  {
                    "column" : "verified"
                  },
                  1
                ]
              },
              {
                "not-null": {
                  "column" : "deleted"
                }
              }
            ]
         }
      },
      "safe" : true,
      "temp" : true
   }
}
```

Could be used to generate this SQL query:

```
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE IF NOT EXISTS inactive_users AS (
  SELECT * FROM users WHERE verified = 1 AND deleted IS NOT NULL
)
```
