# JSON-SQL

JSON-SQL is a specification which defines a standard, database-vendor-agnostic
common SQL statement description (and JSON representation). This is a
specification aims to be a standards-compliant, e.g. SQL-92, and allow for the
development of better SQL statement generation, libraries, object-mappers, and
other tooling. The specification is a valid JSON Schema document which can be
validated using any JSON Schema validator with support for
_"https://json-schema.org/draft/2019-09/schema"_.

## Features

- vendor-agnostic
- language-agnostic
- sql as a data exchange format
- pre-flight sql statement syntax validation
- common sql coverage (99.999% standards-compliant)

## Demonstration

**Note:** Parser and SQL statement generation not included!

This example JSON-SQL data structure:

```
{
   "table-create" : {
      "name" : "removed_users",
      "query" : {
         "select" : {
            "columns" : [
               {
                  "column" : "*"
               }
            ],
            "from" : {
               "table" : "users"
            },
            "where" : [
              {
                "not-null": {
                  "column" : "deleted"
                }
              }
            ]
         }
      },
      "safe" : true,
      "temp" : true
   }
}
```

Could be used to generate this SQL query:

```
CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE IF NOT EXISTS removed_users AS (
  SELECT * FROM users WHERE deleted IS NOT NULL
)
```
